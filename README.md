-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DSKode
-ðŸ‘€ I'm a beginner software developer who recently transitioned into tech out of pure curiosity â€” I wanted to understand how things work beneath the surface. With a background as an account assistant, I bring creativity and attention to detail into my coding journey.
-ðŸ§  I completed a Software Development Bootcamp, where I learned and applied:
-â€¢ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#
-â€¢ Unit testing using xUnit
-â€¢ Built several small, hands-on projects
-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring:
-â€¢ Front-end development and visual creativity
-â€¢ How design and code come together
-â€¢ Writing better, testable code
